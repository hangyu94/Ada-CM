# Ada-CM

This is the official PyTorch implementation of our CVPR 2022 paper:

> [**Towards Semi-Supervised Deep Facial Expression Recognition with An Adaptive Confidence Margin**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.12341)      
> Hangyu Li, Nannan Wang*, Xi Yang, Xiaoyu Wang, Xinbo Gao        
> *In Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2022*

## Getting Started

I will release this code in late April. Thanks for your attention.
